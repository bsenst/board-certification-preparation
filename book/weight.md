# Weight

## How is weight loss defined for B symptoms?
"B symptoms" typically refer to systemic symptoms associated with lymphomas, especially Hodgkin's lymphoma. These symptoms are not related to weight loss specifically but include:
* Fever: Persistent, unexplained fever without signs of infection.
* Night Sweats: Profuse sweating during the night that may drench the patient's sleepwear and sheets.
* Unintentional Weight Loss: Unexplained weight loss exceeding 10% of the body weight over the preceding 6 months.
The unintentional weight loss mentioned as one of the B symptoms is not specific to lymphomas alone
